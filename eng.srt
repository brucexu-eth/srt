1
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:04,960
I think it's a big ship

2
00:00:05,759 --> 00:00:07,919
it's the most comfortable organization I've been in

3
00:00:08,119 --> 00:00:10,720
this organization brings together a group of like-minded people

4
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:11,759
this group of people

5
00:00:12,119 --> 00:00:14,160
has different backgrounds

6
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:15,720
skills or ideas

7
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:18,559
but they have a common characteristic

8
00:00:18,559 --> 00:00:19,920
that is, they have a conscience

9
00:00:19,960 --> 00:00:21,399
interested in Web3

10
00:00:21,399 --> 00:00:23,920
want to explore more possibilities of Web3

11
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:26,920
reliable, conscientious, practical, and not hyped

12
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:29,519
some people who are more long-term or idealistic

13
00:00:29,839 --> 00:00:30,839
and on the one hand

14
00:00:30,839 --> 00:00:33,600
they are filled with the pragmatic spirit of engineers

15
00:00:33,759 --> 00:00:35,520
at the same time, they are not lacking in romanticism

16
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:36,920
and the sentiment of optimism

17
00:00:37,159 --> 00:00:40,200
it is like a pure land of Web3

18
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:41,039
actually

19
00:00:41,560 --> 00:00:44,359
in here, what we discuss is not so much about

20
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:46,359
how to speculate on coins

21
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:47,920
how to make speculative investments

22
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,560
but more focus is on LXDAO

23
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:53,399
as a DAO, it can do this for

24
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:56,759
what can it do for the Web3 ecosystem

25
00:00:56,759 --> 00:00:59,799
LXDAO is still actively exploring Web3

26
00:00:59,799 --> 00:01:00,759
public goods

27
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:03,200
some sustainable solutions

28
00:01:03,399 --> 00:01:04,719
what everyone talks about every day

29
00:01:04,719 --> 00:01:05,719
actually, it's all about some technology

30
00:01:05,719 --> 00:01:06,959
and some things that are oriented

31
00:01:06,959 --> 00:01:07,760
yes

32
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:09,840
less speculative

33
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:12,239
or from a financial perspective

34
00:01:12,239 --> 00:01:14,400
mostly about some projects and some

35
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:16,200
or doing things from the perspective of some products

36
00:01:16,319 --> 00:01:18,840
I think LXDAO is an open

37
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:20,920
free and equal organization

38
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:23,560
and LXDAO is made up of a group

39
00:01:23,799 --> 00:01:26,719
of people who basically haven't met much

40
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:29,719
formed a community together

41
00:01:29,719 --> 00:01:34,359
and cooperated in a very orderly manner

42
00:01:34,439 --> 00:01:36,920
and incubated so many projects

43
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:39,159
how much contribution we made

44
00:01:39,319 --> 00:01:41,319
how much value we produced

45
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:43,799
everything is closely related to our own efforts

46
00:01:43,799 --> 00:01:46,239
the more you contribute, the more valuable your contribution is

47
00:01:46,359 --> 00:01:49,599
the more you speak in this DAO organization, the more authority you have

48
00:01:49,599 --> 00:01:53,359
I think LXDAO is a very loving organization

49
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:55,760
the partners here are very passionate

50
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:57,400
but they are passionate and have a conscience

51
00:01:57,400 --> 00:01:59,560
you can find some

52
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:00,760
very passionate people here

53
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:02,599
and they are happy to

54
00:02:03,239 --> 00:02:06,359
give you some advice or answer your questions

55
00:02:06,359 --> 00:02:08,159
they are willing to answer

56
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:09,240
for example, Bruce

57
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:12,120
he was very enthusiastic to help me when I had questions

58
00:02:12,159 --> 00:02:13,599
after finishing the chat

59
00:02:13,599 --> 00:02:15,960
I realized it was midnight for him

60
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:17,960
I was quite touched by this

61
00:02:18,319 --> 00:02:20,960
as a pure newbie joining LXDAO

62
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:23,520
to be honest, there were many things I didn't understand at the beginning

63
00:02:23,919 --> 00:02:25,159
for something

64
00:02:25,159 --> 00:02:27,039
I even hesitated to ask buddies

65
00:02:27,039 --> 00:02:29,759
but once I plucked up the courage

66
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:31,759
I contacted Ache privately

67
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:35,199
but Ache seemed to sense my anxiety

68
00:02:35,439 --> 00:02:36,719
he replied saying

69
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:39,159
the mission of LXDAO is to

70
00:02:39,159 --> 00:02:41,960
welcome 10 billion users to Web3

71
00:02:42,199 --> 00:02:44,360
we are also actively doing some things

72
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:47,759
and helping newcomers enter the world of Web3

73
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:51,599
for example, our "My First NFT" and "My First Layer2".

74
00:02:51,599 --> 00:02:54,840
help newcomers quickly understand Web3

75
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,199
and safely enter this world

76
00:02:57,599 --> 00:02:59,360
therefore, I believe LXDAO

77
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:00,520
it is a

78
00:03:00,599 --> 00:03:02,400
very good entry point

79
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:04,319
with the right attitude to enter Web3

80
00:03:04,319 --> 00:03:05,719
that can help more people

81
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:07,439
enter the world of Web3

82
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:14,960
hello, I am WangTeng

83
00:03:15,759 --> 00:03:17,159
a UI designer

84
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:21,159
I got to know LXDAO through the GCLX

85
00:03:21,159 --> 00:03:23,319
at that time, I found it very interesting

86
00:03:23,599 --> 00:03:25,120
and wanted to know the people behind it

87
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:27,360
it was Bruce and Muxin at first

88
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:29,639
and then I had the opportunity to join LXDAO

89
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:31,439
And the second question is

90
00:03:31,439 --> 00:03:33,120
Why choose to participate in LXDAO

91
00:03:33,759 --> 00:03:36,960
I feel that LXDAO is very professional

92
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:38,159
In the field of Web3

93
00:03:38,319 --> 00:03:41,159
And it's also a group of very professional people inside

94
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:42,039
Doing things

95
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:44,159
Another reason is

96
00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:46,919
LXDAO actually has another name called "Appearance DAO"

97
00:03:47,639 --> 00:03:50,000
There are really many DAO flowers in our LXDAO

98
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,120
Yes, right

99
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:52,759
We hope that everyone

100
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:54,560
Can come and take a look

101
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:56,759
Hello everyone, I am Muxin.

102
00:03:56,759 --> 00:03:59,199
One of the co-founders of LXDAO.

103
00:04:00,159 --> 00:04:03,960
Initially, I collaborated with Bruce on

104
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,439
the project "Domestic Goodwill NFT".

105
00:04:06,719 --> 00:04:10,400
Then later, I initiated "My First NFT"

106
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:11,199
in the community.

107
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:15,319
At that time, everyone gathered because of "Domestic Goodwill NFT".

108
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:16,920
and came together.

109
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:19,240
When Bruce proposed this idea,

110
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:21,199
many people responded.

111
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:24,160
and actively participated in its construction.

112
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:27,120
Actually, everyone didn't know each other.

113
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:28,959
and just because of an idea,

114
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:31,160
they identified with this idea,

115
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:33,800
wanted to contribute their part,

116
00:04:33,839 --> 00:04:35,160
and gathered together.

117
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:37,560
and successfully completed the project.

118
00:04:37,639 --> 00:04:40,360
So, I found it very interesting.

119
00:04:40,399 --> 00:04:42,000
and this experience,

120
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:45,319
I never had it before in my past.

121
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:47,439
And then, we were also thinking

122
00:04:47,439 --> 00:04:49,720
if we could establish a DAO organization

123
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:52,920
and gather more people with the same core

124
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:55,399
to do more valuable things

125
00:04:55,519 --> 00:04:57,759
So, LXDAO was established

126
00:04:58,199 --> 00:04:59,600
Hello everyone

127
00:05:00,319 --> 00:05:02,319
Hello everyone, I am Sanzhi

128
00:05:02,319 --> 00:05:05,240
Currently, I am in the operations team of LXDAO

129
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:09,040
Then, I collaborated with Bruce

130
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:11,600
around February or March last year

131
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:15,040
I got to know Bruce through "My First NFT"

132
00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:16,839
He had a recruitment post at that time

133
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:20,560
After adding Bruce on WeChat

134
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:23,360
I joined LXDAO

135
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:25,199
around December

136
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:28,120
Because I saw he was recruiting for operations

137
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:30,439
I went to the weekly meeting

138
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:32,560
and introduced myself

139
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:35,360
My self-introduction was quite

140
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:38,399
honest. I said, "Hello, I am Sanzhi."

141
00:05:38,519 --> 00:05:39,720
And I don't have

142
00:05:40,319 --> 00:05:42,519
much experience in operations

143
00:05:42,519 --> 00:05:45,199
But I've been doing planning

144
00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:46,519
especially event planning

145
00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:48,839
I'm quite skilled in this area.

146
00:05:48,839 --> 00:05:49,920
If you all don't mind

147
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:51,639
and are willing to give me a chance

148
00:05:51,639 --> 00:05:53,959
I'd be happy to join LXDAO

149
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:55,360
as a member

150
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:59,360
and then I started my journey inside LXDAO

151
00:05:59,639 --> 00:06:00,959
And the second point,

152
00:06:00,959 --> 00:06:03,319
why I chose to participate in LXDAO,

153
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:04,319
Firstly,

154
00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:08,439
I actually see the potential in the entire Web3 ecosystem.

155
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:10,720
And as for LXDAO,

156
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:13,560
a friend mentioned it to me before,

157
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:15,839
he felt that LXDAO has the capability

158
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:19,759
from an idea to a product,

159
00:06:19,839 --> 00:06:21,759
there's potential,

160
00:06:21,759 --> 00:06:23,839
it's like a dream factory here.

161
00:06:23,839 --> 00:06:26,160
It can turn your ideas

162
00:06:26,399 --> 00:06:28,199
into realized products.

163
00:06:28,439 --> 00:06:29,199
I have ideas too,

164
00:06:29,199 --> 00:06:29,959
so,

165
00:06:29,959 --> 00:06:30,639
I want

166
00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:33,639
my ideas to blossom here.

167
00:06:33,639 --> 00:06:35,160
Hi everyone, I am Cikey,

168
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:37,160
today let's talk about LXDAO.

169
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,040
My first encounter with LXDAO was,

170
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:41,240
Actually, it was because of Sanzhi,

171
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:44,000
At that time, we were both volunteering in Haimen,

172
00:06:44,399 --> 00:06:46,040
She was always so passionate,

173
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:47,639
immersing herself in her endeavors,

174
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:49,519
which made me very curious,

175
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:50,800
her unwavering focus,

176
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:52,319
as if the noise around her

177
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:53,560
couldn't touch her,

178
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:56,199
because we all loved to have fun back then,

179
00:06:56,199 --> 00:06:57,920
but she was always

180
00:06:58,759 --> 00:06:59,639
unaffected,

181
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
I started to wonder,

182
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,519
what exactly was it

183
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:04,639
that ignited her passion so much,

184
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,319
that she'd dive into it without hesitation,

185
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:11,000
LXDAO, as the first DAO I came across,

186
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:14,040
started my novice exploration journey in Web3,

187
00:07:14,399 --> 00:07:17,360
So, why did I join LXDAO?

188
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:19,839
Actually, the answer is simple,

189
00:07:19,839 --> 00:07:21,600
I feel it's not just an organization,

190
00:07:21,759 --> 00:07:24,600
but a vibrant community full of opportunities,

191
00:07:24,959 --> 00:07:26,759
I'm attracted by this interest-driven

192
00:07:26,959 --> 00:07:29,839
and passion-driven collaboration,

193
00:07:30,519 --> 00:07:31,959
I hope to continuously

194
00:07:31,959 --> 00:07:33,920
learn and grow in this creative

195
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:34,959
and open environment,

196
00:07:34,959 --> 00:07:35,560
to evolve,

197
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:37,720
and explore with like-minded friends,

198
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:39,160
the unknown future of Web3,

199
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:41,000
Also, another point is,

200
00:07:41,399 --> 00:07:43,959
Hey, look at the sea behind me.

201
00:07:44,319 --> 00:07:47,319
Is this also a reason why I joined?

202
00:07:47,319 --> 00:07:48,920
Because it feels like it's not bound

203
00:07:49,959 --> 00:07:51,639
by time and space,

204
00:07:51,959 --> 00:07:53,399
possessing endless possibilities.

205
00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:54,399
Hello everyone,

206
00:07:54,399 --> 00:07:57,160
I am Bruce, a co-founder of LXDAO.

207
00:07:57,759 --> 00:07:58,920
Actually, last year,

208
00:07:58,920 --> 00:07:59,720
I initially

209
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:02,720
launched a project called "My First NFT".

210
00:08:02,959 --> 00:08:04,160
And this project,

211
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:07,319
is a completely free, charitable NFT

212
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:08,920
tutorial,

213
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:11,920
including how to buy and sell NFTs and

214
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:14,399
how to perform safe operations.

215
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:17,560
Then, when I made this proposal,

216
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:21,160
it attracted over 20 friends

217
00:08:21,439 --> 00:08:23,519
to co-build this project together.

218
00:08:23,839 --> 00:08:25,319
This was quite astonishing to me,

219
00:08:25,319 --> 00:08:27,319
because it made me realize

220
00:08:27,319 --> 00:08:28,639
in this speculative

221
00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:30,759
or impetuous Web3 world,

222
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:32,000
there's still a group of people

223
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,600
willing to invest time in things

224
00:08:34,759 --> 00:08:36,159
that can promote Web3

225
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:39,120
development.

226
00:08:39,799 --> 00:08:41,159
And this group,

227
00:08:41,159 --> 00:08:42,799
I believe they need a place

228
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:44,759
where everyone can communicate, learn,

229
00:08:44,759 --> 00:08:46,360
and even collaborate on projects.

230
00:08:46,639 --> 00:08:49,000
And LXDAO is such a place.

231
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,960
I am one of those people.

232
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:52,360
At first,

233
00:08:52,639 --> 00:08:56,000
I got to know about the EIP Fun project.

234
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:59,159
Then, I joined the EIP Fun Telegram group,

235
00:08:59,639 --> 00:09:00,840
and I've been lurking there.

236
00:09:01,159 --> 00:09:03,200
While lurking,

237
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:05,519
I got to know about LXDAO.

238
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:08,399
After getting to know it, I followed its official account.

239
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:12,240
Gradually, with deeper discussions and learning,

240
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:13,440
I realized that

241
00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:16,559
the purpose of LXDAO is to sustainably support

242
00:09:16,759 --> 00:09:17,960
the development of public goods.

243
00:09:18,399 --> 00:09:20,759
With a deeper understanding of public goods,

244
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:21,759
I realized that

245
00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:23,919
it's a very meaningful thing.

246
00:09:23,919 --> 00:09:24,960
Why do I say that?

247
00:09:25,039 --> 00:09:27,320
In real life, public goods are like water,

248
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:28,759
air, sunlight,

249
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:30,320
roads, lighting systems,

250
00:09:30,559 --> 00:09:32,000
and parks.

251
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:32,960
And we know that

252
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:34,639
these things often determine

253
00:09:34,639 --> 00:09:36,039
the development of a region or country.

254
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:37,200
Their development,

255
00:09:37,759 --> 00:09:39,720
has a significant impact

256
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:41,320
on their economic model.

257
00:09:41,559 --> 00:09:45,000
So, in certain areas, it's a fundamental factor.

258
00:09:45,559 --> 00:09:48,600
So, when it comes to the internet realm,

259
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:50,039
internet public products,

260
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:50,639
undoubtedly,

261
00:09:50,639 --> 00:09:52,720
are the cornerstone of the entire internet ecosystem.

262
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:54,159
What we are doing now,

263
00:09:54,159 --> 00:09:57,120
supporting Web3 public goods,

264
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:58,320
this vision, this goal,

265
00:09:58,559 --> 00:10:01,360
is to create a better

266
00:10:01,639 --> 00:10:02,559
ecosystem for Web3,

267
00:10:02,559 --> 00:10:03,360
more positive,

268
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:05,639
sustainable, and upward-moving ecosystem.

269
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:08,799
So, with deeper discussions and deeper learning,

270
00:10:08,919 --> 00:10:09,720
then,

271
00:10:10,159 --> 00:10:11,000
In my heart,

272
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:13,519
The vision of LXDAO

273
00:10:13,519 --> 00:10:15,840
gradually aligns with my personal vision.

274
00:10:16,159 --> 00:10:17,759
I think about building,

275
00:10:17,759 --> 00:10:19,320
constructing such a positive

276
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:20,240
and active ecosystem.

277
00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:24,039
Such a goal sounds exciting enough.

278
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:26,120
I believe with such a goal,

279
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:28,240
it's enough to attract like-minded individuals

280
00:10:28,559 --> 00:10:29,440
to join.

281
00:10:30,159 --> 00:10:33,840
Hello, thanks for the invitation from LXDAO.

282
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:35,360
First, let's talk about the first question,

283
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:38,320
how I got to know LXDAO.

284
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:39,000
Regarding LXDAO,

285
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,559
actually, I first heard about it

286
00:10:40,639 --> 00:10:41,759
at the end of 2021,

287
00:10:41,759 --> 00:10:43,840
when they launched a project called "National Conscience."

288
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:44,960
It became quite popular instantly.

289
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:47,000
As someone who trades NFTs,

290
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,759
I noticed this project at that time.

291
00:10:48,759 --> 00:10:49,559
But,

292
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:51,720
unfortunately, I didn't get a chance to buy it.

293
00:10:51,759 --> 00:10:52,759
To buy into this project.

294
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:55,360
Then, almost a year later,

295
00:10:55,360 --> 00:11:00,039
around November or December of 2022,

296
00:11:00,159 --> 00:11:02,159
I was working on a hackathon project.

297
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:03,120
This hackathon project

298
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:05,440
was closely related to Marry3.

299
00:11:05,559 --> 00:11:08,000
So, I did some research on Marry3,

300
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:08,759
and found out...

301
00:11:08,759 --> 00:11:11,559
Hey, behind Marry3 there's an organization called LXDAO.

302
00:11:11,559 --> 00:11:13,720
This organization even writes weekly reports.

303
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:14,840
My goodness, they're so diligent!

304
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:17,600
I've never seen a more open and transparent

305
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:18,799
and truly active

306
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:20,159
DAO organization.

307
00:11:20,159 --> 00:11:22,159
Because I've been part of some DAO organizations before,

308
00:11:22,159 --> 00:11:23,960
and in reality,

309
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:26,200
their governance level

310
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:28,440
doesn't match up to LXDAO's standard.

311
00:11:28,559 --> 00:11:31,320
It made me feel that LXDAO truly understands DAO,

312
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:33,559
and has a strong DAO consciousness,

313
00:11:33,919 --> 00:11:35,039
and the determination to run a DAO.

314
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:36,360
So,

315
00:11:36,559 --> 00:11:37,960
I gradually

316
00:11:38,559 --> 00:11:41,600
got involved in some of LXDAO's work.

317
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:42,559
At first,

318
00:11:42,559 --> 00:11:43,320
I participated in

319
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:45,559
creating our publication page,

320
00:11:45,559 --> 00:11:47,960
and then I joined the development of Donate3

321
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:50,919
and the My First Layer2 project.

322
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:54,159
Yes, this is the T-shirt from My First Layer2.

323
00:11:54,399 --> 00:11:55,240
And then,

324
00:11:55,639 --> 00:11:58,639
gradually, I became one of LXDAO's

325
00:11:59,039 --> 00:12:01,200
how should I put it...

326
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:02,559
Um,

327
00:12:02,559 --> 00:12:05,799
one of the prominent LXP

328
00:12:06,159 --> 00:12:07,759
builders.

329
00:12:08,039 --> 00:12:08,759
And actually,

330
00:12:08,759 --> 00:12:10,919
this already answers the second question.

331
00:12:10,919 --> 00:12:12,440
Because...

332
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:15,360
I truly realized that LXDAO is actively working.

333
00:12:15,759 --> 00:12:17,919
And the direction LXDAO is taking

334
00:12:17,919 --> 00:12:19,000
Is really interesting.

335
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,559
It greatly piques my interest.

336
00:12:20,559 --> 00:12:22,320
We are working on public goods.

337
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:23,600
It's a research and development DAO, right?

338
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:24,759
What are public goods?

339
00:12:24,759 --> 00:12:26,360
It's actually very

340
00:12:26,559 --> 00:12:28,759
Altruistic outcomes.

341
00:12:29,159 --> 00:12:30,919
For me personally,

342
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:32,799
How should I put it...

343
00:12:32,799 --> 00:12:35,720
I really derive joy from the process of helping others.

344
00:12:35,759 --> 00:12:36,720
It's fulfilling.

345
00:12:36,759 --> 00:12:39,279
I also hope, as a programmer, to create some

346
00:12:39,279 --> 00:12:42,639
Things that can provide value to others.

347
00:12:42,639 --> 00:12:45,039
Products that truly offer value.

348
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:46,120
Of course,

349
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:47,200
The commercial interests

350
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:49,559
Are actually secondary.

351
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:50,720
Yes, so,

352
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:54,399
I think LXDAO can be a place where

353
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:57,559
I can truly realize my greater potential.

354
00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:00,120
Hello everyone, I am Marcus.

355
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:01,759
I am currently a game developer.

356
00:13:01,759 --> 00:13:04,000
I am in charge of an AIGC product.

357
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:05,559
And I also do some

358
00:13:05,559 --> 00:13:07,639
Governance and operational work at LXDAO.

359
00:13:07,639 --> 00:13:10,039
So, how did I get to know LXDAO?

360
00:13:10,039 --> 00:13:12,559
Initially, it was because I joined "国产良心" (Domestic Conscience).

361
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:13,360
This community,

362
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:15,240
And then became a committed HOLDER of it.

363
00:13:15,559 --> 00:13:17,559
Through this,

364
00:13:17,559 --> 00:13:19,519
I gradually started working with everyone.

365
00:13:19,519 --> 00:13:22,559
And I found that the conversations and chats were very interesting.

366
00:13:22,759 --> 00:13:24,360
The people here are really fascinating.

367
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:25,759
That kind of feeling.

368
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:27,039
And then I joined LXDAO.

369
00:13:27,039 --> 00:13:29,240
Later on, "国产良心" (Domestic Conscience) also became LXDAO.

370
00:13:29,559 --> 00:13:32,559
Hmm, it was established with a certain gene or foundation.

371
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:35,600
Actually, I originally had a somewhat negative impression of domestic products.

372
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:36,200
Prejudiced, indeed.

373
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:38,759
Because I entered the circle relatively early,

374
00:13:38,759 --> 00:13:41,240
And was "rug pulled" by many domestic projects.

375
00:13:41,559 --> 00:13:42,799
Yes, that's right.

376
00:13:42,919 --> 00:13:44,960
So, I had some biases against domestic products.

377
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:47,759
But when I bought into this "国产新" (New Domestic) project,

378
00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:50,120
I found it particularly interesting.

379
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:51,840
Firstly, the design of its website,

380
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:53,519
And its text, copywriting, and such.

381
00:13:53,519 --> 00:13:54,639
I found it particularly interesting.

382
00:13:54,759 --> 00:13:56,159
It has that ironic feel.

383
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:57,759
And after I joined the community,

384
00:13:57,759 --> 00:14:00,799
I realized that everyone was just chatting every day,

385
00:14:00,799 --> 00:14:02,159
Asking the project team for refunds,

386
00:14:02,159 --> 00:14:03,440
And when the project team would run away.

387
00:14:03,639 --> 00:14:04,799
Such amusing matters.

388
00:14:04,799 --> 00:14:06,559
I was drawn to this community atmosphere.

389
00:14:06,799 --> 00:14:08,159
All because of "国产良心" (Domestic Conscience).

390
00:14:08,159 --> 00:14:09,159
This community vibe.

391
00:14:09,159 --> 00:14:10,840
I feel that being with a group of interesting,

392
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:12,360
and down-to-earth people,

393
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:14,519
is particularly meaningful.

394
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:15,440
Hello everyone,

395
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:16,600
I am Mike.

396
00:14:17,039 --> 00:14:17,960
And the first question is,

397
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:19,639
How did you get to know LXDAO?

398
00:14:19,639 --> 00:14:22,000
Well, it was over a year ago,

399
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:25,120
there was an NFT project called "国产良心" (Domestic Conscience).

400
00:14:25,559 --> 00:14:29,039
At that time, I approached it with a "do your own research" attitude.

401
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:31,159
I carefully reviewed the content of the website,

402
00:14:31,159 --> 00:14:32,399
and found it very funny.

403
00:14:32,759 --> 00:14:34,039
But before I could finish,

404
00:14:34,159 --> 00:14:35,759
the NFTs were already minted.

405
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:37,600
During this process,

406
00:14:38,159 --> 00:14:40,759
I kept a close eye on the development of LXDAO.

407
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:42,399
At the beginning of this year,

408
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:43,799
LXDAO launched a project,

409
00:14:43,799 --> 00:14:46,200
called EIPs Fun.

410
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:48,759
I felt that I could learn a lot from it.

411
00:14:48,759 --> 00:14:49,960
I also found it meaningful,

412
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:51,759
so I signed up for this project.

413
00:14:51,759 --> 00:14:53,159
In the role of a product manager,

414
00:14:53,159 --> 00:14:55,200
I later got to know Bruce,

415
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:56,759
SanZhi, and other core

416
00:14:56,759 --> 00:14:58,000
builders of LXDAO.

417
00:14:59,440 --> 00:14:59,919
Ah,

418
00:14:59,919 --> 00:15:02,559
The second question is, why did I choose to participate in LXDAO?

419
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:04,720
I think the core reason is the people,

420
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:06,559
a group of contributors.

421
00:15:06,559 --> 00:15:08,960
They are very supportive, open, and inclusive,

422
00:15:09,039 --> 00:15:10,759
and also very genuine.

423
00:15:10,759 --> 00:15:13,960
Some people might think that the people in LXDAO

424
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:14,799
are very amateur,

425
00:15:14,919 --> 00:15:17,919
but in reality, they might be even more professional than you think,

426
00:15:18,159 --> 00:15:19,240
and very native.

427
00:15:19,639 --> 00:15:21,639
Hello everyone, I am Ray.

428
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:23,960
I first came into contact with LXDAO

429
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:26,919
through the NFT "National Conscience."

430
00:15:27,159 --> 00:15:29,960
At the peak of the NFT market,

431
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:32,159
which was full of chaos,

432
00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:35,200
"National Conscience" emerged,

433
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:36,799
and I was greatly shocked.

434
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,759
I realized that NFTs could be done this way,

435
00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:42,519
so I minted two on the official website.

436
00:15:42,519 --> 00:15:44,159
They are still in my wallet now,

437
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:45,960
I don't know if they have become worthless,

438
00:15:46,399 --> 00:15:47,519
I should check later.

439
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:50,639
After "National Conscience,"

440
00:15:50,759 --> 00:15:52,200
LXDAO was established.

441
00:15:52,559 --> 00:15:54,360
One thing LXDAO does is

442
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:57,039
to popularize knowledge about NFTs to everyone,

443
00:15:57,039 --> 00:16:01,240
as well as how to use and mint NFTs.

444
00:16:01,559 --> 00:16:02,399
In this project,

445
00:16:02,399 --> 00:16:04,759
I also contributed some minor modifications.

446
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:06,799
And during this process, I found out

447
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:09,120
that the people in LXDAO are indeed

448
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:11,120
both interesting and conscientious.

449
00:16:11,159 --> 00:16:12,559
So, I applied

450
00:16:12,759 --> 00:16:15,519
to become a builder in LXDAO,

451
00:16:15,559 --> 00:16:17,360
and have been

452
00:16:17,759 --> 00:16:18,559
until today.

453
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:20,720
Over the past year or so,

454
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:24,159
I have also witnessed the development of LXDAO.

455
00:16:24,759 --> 00:16:25,840
Hello everyone, I am Samo.

456
00:16:25,919 --> 00:16:28,159
A cross-disciplinary learner who knows a bit about technology,

457
00:16:28,159 --> 00:16:31,000
finance, and macroeconomics.

458
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:33,600
I had heard about LXDAO before,

459
00:16:33,639 --> 00:16:35,159
but didn't know much about it.

460
00:16:35,159 --> 00:16:37,639
My first impression was that it's an organization focused on public goods.

461
00:16:37,799 --> 00:16:38,919
A public welfare DAO organization.

462
00:16:39,799 --> 00:16:41,840
I'm very interested in popularizing knowledge.

463
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:43,960
Initially, I was skeptical about the efficiency

464
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:45,919
of a DAO doing public goods.

465
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:47,120
But after joining,

466
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:49,200
I found out that LXDAO has already completed more than ten projects.

467
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:50,200
I was quite amazed.

468
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:52,720
At first, I was invited

469
00:16:53,159 --> 00:16:55,759
by a friend to join a popularization project,

470
00:16:56,120 --> 00:16:58,360
which is "My First Layer2".

471
00:16:58,759 --> 00:17:00,000
During the project,

472
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,360
I felt that the atmosphere of this DAO organization was very good.

473
00:17:03,039 --> 00:17:05,119
Firstly, collaborating with the project's designers

474
00:17:05,119 --> 00:17:07,359
and developers was very pleasant.

475
00:17:08,119 --> 00:17:09,319
Also, sometimes during meetings,

476
00:17:09,519 --> 00:17:13,039
and regular communications, I felt everyone was very nice.

477
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:14,799
I really like the atmosphere here.

478
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:19,000
Hello everyone, I am Seven.

479
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,720
I first learned about LXDAO

480
00:17:20,759 --> 00:17:23,240
from an article by Bruce.

481
00:17:23,359 --> 00:17:26,559
At that time, what left a deep impression on me was Bruce's understanding

482
00:17:26,759 --> 00:17:28,960
of the two different organizational forms:

483
00:17:29,359 --> 00:17:31,559
DAO and companies.

484
00:17:31,599 --> 00:17:33,359
He made a very vivid analogy,

485
00:17:33,359 --> 00:17:35,160
saying that DAOs and companies

486
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:37,160
might be like hammers and axes.

487
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:39,160
When you're nailing,

488
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:40,559
a hammer is definitely more useful.

489
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:41,640
But when splitting wood,

490
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:44,039
an axe is definitely more efficient.

491
00:17:44,039 --> 00:17:46,920
I strongly agree with this perspective.

492
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:48,000
And I also feel that

493
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:50,839
LXDAO might be a more

494
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:52,599
pragmatic,

495
00:17:52,599 --> 00:17:54,440
down-to-earth kind of DAO.

496
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:55,559
Rather than one that

497
00:17:55,599 --> 00:17:58,519
primarily outputs ideology.

498
00:17:58,519 --> 00:18:00,440
This was my initial impression

499
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:02,200
of LXDAO.

500
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:05,759
Then, why did I join LXDAO?

501
00:18:05,759 --> 00:18:09,960
Actually, I joined many Chinese DAO communities at that time,

502
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:12,119
and I was also observing them,

503
00:18:12,119 --> 00:18:14,559
including their governance rules, style of action,

504
00:18:14,599 --> 00:18:16,359
and the projects they were involved in, etc.

505
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:19,000
LXDAO gave me a feeling that it was

506
00:18:19,359 --> 00:18:21,359
very sincere and genuine,

507
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:24,160
down-to-earth without any fluff.

508
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:28,160
And whether it's their website or products,

509
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:32,160
be it user experience, design, aesthetics, or professionalism, everything is

510
00:18:32,599 --> 00:18:33,519
on point.

511
00:18:33,559 --> 00:18:34,799
The first product I tried

512
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:38,000
was "My First NFT".

513
00:18:38,559 --> 00:18:41,319
Wow, I really think that product deserves 99 points.

514
00:18:41,319 --> 00:18:42,519
Haha, yes.

515
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:45,759
It directly hit the target of the product.

516
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:47,319
The remaining one point

517
00:18:47,319 --> 00:18:47,960
might be my hope

518
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:50,799
that they continue to develop it,

519
00:18:50,799 --> 00:18:53,440
enriching the content and expanding it further.

520
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:56,119
Another thing is that I

521
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:57,960
Because I am an INFP,

522
00:18:58,119 --> 00:18:59,799
I am a very idealistic person.

523
00:18:59,799 --> 00:19:00,640
So,

524
00:19:00,759 --> 00:19:03,599
the word "conscience" really touches me.

525
00:19:03,799 --> 00:19:07,160
I can feel a very simple and

526
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:10,559
sincere longing for something better.

527
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,599
Of course, I think it's not just about slogans,

528
00:19:13,759 --> 00:19:16,319
from why the DAO was established,

529
00:19:16,359 --> 00:19:19,160
to all the projects they've done over the year,

530
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:20,720
including their mission and vision,

531
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:23,640
governance rules, and the overall community atmosphere,

532
00:19:23,759 --> 00:19:24,799
in every word and deed,

533
00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:26,960
I feel they are very consistent in thought and action.

534
00:19:27,160 --> 00:19:28,559
Yes, this is

535
00:19:29,559 --> 00:19:29,920
what I

536
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:33,559
truly feel, this sincerity and conscience.

537
00:19:33,559 --> 00:19:35,160
So, I wanted to join.

538
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:36,960
Even though I'm not a programmer,

539
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:38,519
and don't have an internet background,

540
00:19:38,559 --> 00:19:39,759
I believe

541
00:19:39,799 --> 00:19:41,400
I hope to contribute

542
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:42,640
as much as I can here.

543
00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:44,000
Contribute, right.

544
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,960
Of course, I can also learn a lot and make many

545
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:48,200
conscientious friends here.

546
00:19:50,559 --> 00:19:52,359
Hi everyone,

547
00:19:52,759 --> 00:19:54,240
You can call me Tiao.

548
00:19:55,759 --> 00:19:58,119
I first got to know LXDAO in

549
00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:00,359
around April this year.

550
00:20:00,519 --> 00:20:01,640
At that time, I

551
00:20:02,319 --> 00:20:06,640
I was in the LXDAO English translation WeChat group.

552
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:10,440
And then I started trying to find some

553
00:20:10,759 --> 00:20:11,559
tasks to do.

554
00:20:12,519 --> 00:20:14,440
Why did I choose to participate in LXDAO?

555
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:17,359
Well, one reason is that

556
00:20:17,359 --> 00:20:17,759
here,

557
00:20:17,759 --> 00:20:20,839
I can, through my own efforts, obtain some

558
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:21,960
income.

559
00:20:22,599 --> 00:20:23,559
Of course, well,

560
00:20:23,559 --> 00:20:24,440
in other places,

561
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:25,640
everyone can earn some income

562
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:27,240
through their efforts.

563
00:20:27,799 --> 00:20:30,200
But I feel that here,

564
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:34,240
the distribution of income is more fair and transparent.

565
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:35,839
Another point is that

566
00:20:36,599 --> 00:20:39,039
I'm personally interested in the Web3 field.

567
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:40,400
Well, because

568
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:43,440
I think the Web3 field hasn't been fully defined yet,

569
00:20:43,519 --> 00:20:45,440
it's not structured.

570
00:20:45,759 --> 00:20:50,160
For example, you can see a lot of speculative things here,

571
00:20:50,359 --> 00:20:53,359
Many speculative things,

572
00:20:54,359 --> 00:20:58,240
but at the same time, there are also many imaginative things,

573
00:20:58,440 --> 00:20:59,759
things that are different.

574
00:20:59,759 --> 00:21:01,599
For example, the concept of DAO.

575
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:05,640
This is also what initially attracted me to Web3.

576
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:07,039
Things.

577
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:09,039
So I think that here,

578
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:11,400
doing things and learning

579
00:21:11,759 --> 00:21:13,359
are meaningful.

580
00:21:13,359 --> 00:21:16,559
Well, and right now, I also want to do some...

581
00:21:16,599 --> 00:21:19,559
I also want to do a graduate thesis related to governance.

582
00:21:19,759 --> 00:21:23,160
I have a background in social sciences myself,

583
00:21:23,359 --> 00:21:27,160
and I think applying what I've learned from other places

584
00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:29,440
to this field

585
00:21:30,119 --> 00:21:31,559
is actually quite interesting.

586
00:21:37,759 --> 00:21:40,759
One interesting thing I find in LXDAO

587
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:43,400
I find quite interesting.

588
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:45,400
For example, I think, I think, I think

589
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:46,440
Marcus is quite interesting.

590
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:47,599
Hahaha.

591
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:50,240
Hmm, yes. Previously,

592
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:53,559
Bruce mentioned in a meeting, he said, "Hey,

593
00:21:53,559 --> 00:21:54,559
Aren't you in New Zealand?

594
00:21:54,559 --> 00:21:56,519
Haven't you been in Singapore for so long?

595
00:21:56,519 --> 00:21:57,920
Your English is so bad."

596
00:21:58,039 --> 00:22:01,599
Everyone is very straightforward and honest.

597
00:22:01,640 --> 00:22:03,839
I find this aspect quite interesting.

598
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:07,559
The third point I find interesting is

599
00:22:08,759 --> 00:22:09,960
Right from the beginning,

600
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:11,960
we insist on using DAO and Web3

601
00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:13,440
to run in a native way,

602
00:22:13,799 --> 00:22:17,759
and also gradually decentralize.

603
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:20,359
At the same time, we adhere to the principle of not free-riding,

604
00:22:20,599 --> 00:22:23,440
although our treasury is not abundant,

605
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:25,759
we still try to allocate funds within the budget

606
00:22:25,759 --> 00:22:28,359
to contributors who have made contributions.

607
00:22:28,599 --> 00:22:30,799
So, many people don't have high expectations for us,

608
00:22:31,119 --> 00:22:32,559
including myself last year,

609
00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:35,559
but what I find very interesting is

610
00:22:35,720 --> 00:22:37,440
up to now,

611
00:22:37,799 --> 00:22:39,559
This system can indeed operate,

612
00:22:39,640 --> 00:22:41,160
and it's getting better and better.

613
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:44,640
I think the decentralized office format of our DAO

614
00:22:45,559 --> 00:22:47,359
is very interesting.

615
00:22:47,359 --> 00:22:51,240
For example, in meetings, you'll find some people on vacation,

616
00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:54,519
some by the seaside, some in the countryside, and so on.

617
00:22:55,359 --> 00:22:57,839
As long as everyone has an internet connection, they can work together.

618
00:22:58,039 --> 00:22:59,960
And the efficiency is very high.

619
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:01,920
I find this interesting.

620
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:04,119
This is also what I think,

621
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:06,400
A very interesting point.

622
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:08,119
Actually, for me personally,

623
00:23:08,119 --> 00:23:12,440
I haven't met any

624
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:14,400
member of LXDAO in person.

625
00:23:14,519 --> 00:23:17,920
But actually, this doesn't hinder us from working together

626
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:20,119
on quite a few things.

627
00:23:20,160 --> 00:23:24,200
And actually, the whole process is very smooth,

628
00:23:24,359 --> 00:23:26,559
and there aren't any significant obstacles.

629
00:23:26,759 --> 00:23:27,599
So I think

630
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:30,759
this kind of LXDAO is very good.

631
00:23:30,759 --> 00:23:31,960
This kind of community atmosphere,

632
00:23:31,960 --> 00:23:35,039
and everyone striving together for a common vision,

633
00:23:35,160 --> 00:23:36,160
working together,

634
00:23:36,160 --> 00:23:38,960
I think that's what attracts me the most

635
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:39,759
about a place.

636
00:23:39,839 --> 00:23:42,559
The most interesting part, I think, is

637
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:47,119
because there's no boss or CEO here,

638
00:23:47,359 --> 00:23:49,359
but it seems like everyone knows

639
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:51,559
how to work together

640
00:23:52,599 --> 00:23:55,160
and at the same time, everyone is learning.

641
00:23:55,759 --> 00:23:56,920
Learning together,

642
00:23:56,920 --> 00:23:58,960
exploring how to work together more efficiently,

643
00:23:58,960 --> 00:23:59,759
and at the same time,

644
00:24:00,559 --> 00:24:02,599
allowing everyone to be free

645
00:24:02,599 --> 00:24:04,559
to work in this way.

646
00:24:04,759 --> 00:24:07,799
Now, LXDAO has over 100 members,

647
00:24:07,799 --> 00:24:10,920
and everyone comes from different fields

648
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:13,920
with different professional backgrounds.

649
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:17,039
There are programmers, designers,

650
00:24:17,039 --> 00:24:18,799
product managers, and operations

651
00:24:18,799 --> 00:24:22,160
And investors, consultants,

652
00:24:22,359 --> 00:24:25,119
a variety of backgrounds,

653
00:24:25,119 --> 00:24:26,920
and everyone gathers together

654
00:24:26,920 --> 00:24:29,359
to contribute their ideas.

655
00:24:29,359 --> 00:24:32,000
If others agree with your idea,

656
00:24:32,359 --> 00:24:34,559
you can initiate a proposal

657
00:24:34,559 --> 00:24:36,400
and create a project group

658
00:24:36,440 --> 00:24:38,400
to turn your idea into reality.

659
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:42,359
And it feels very interesting and cool.

660
00:24:42,559 --> 00:24:45,000
Secondly, it's also about

661
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:47,759
Although LXDAO now has over 100 members,

662
00:24:47,759 --> 00:24:49,160
in fact,

663
00:24:49,559 --> 00:24:52,440
some of the older members from before are no longer active,

664
00:24:52,440 --> 00:24:56,119
and there are more and more new members joining.

665
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:58,519
And LXDAO is still

666
00:24:58,559 --> 00:25:01,000
operating very well.

667
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:03,960
I think this point is quite interesting.

668
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:06,920
In fact, at the beginning,

669
00:25:07,319 --> 00:25:09,119
LXDAO was organized with

670
00:25:09,119 --> 00:25:10,640
about 20 or so people.

671
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:12,240
There weren't many people,

672
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:14,119
but because it was small,

673
00:25:14,319 --> 00:25:17,599
things got done faster

674
00:25:17,599 --> 00:25:18,759
and more efficiently.

675
00:25:18,759 --> 00:25:19,559
But later on,

676
00:25:19,559 --> 00:25:22,799
when LXDAO grew to around 50 or 60 people,

677
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:25,359
some governance issues arose.

678
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:28,960
Some of our old members became inactive,

679
00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:30,200
and to achieve voting,

680
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:32,759
you had to ask some of the old members to

681
00:25:33,039 --> 00:25:33,839
participate in governance.

682
00:25:33,839 --> 00:25:35,559
But these old members might be busy

683
00:25:35,759 --> 00:25:36,559
and not have the time

684
00:25:36,559 --> 00:25:39,000
to carefully review the proposals.

685
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:40,960
Later on, to address these issues,

686
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:44,759
we also proposed some methods at the Season Summit,

687
00:25:44,759 --> 00:25:48,400
such as representative systems and more.

688
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:50,519
Suddenly, we realized

689
00:25:50,519 --> 00:25:52,759
why the Western world has that kind of

690
00:25:53,119 --> 00:25:54,759
democratic system,

691
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:56,759
and why China has its

692
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:59,000
system of people's representatives.

693
00:25:59,319 --> 00:26:03,200
I find this area quite interesting.

694
00:26:03,359 --> 00:26:04,039
Just in my opinion,

695
00:26:04,039 --> 00:26:06,960
in fact, the cultural symbol of conscience is the most intriguing.

696
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:09,960
Why do I say that?

697
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:12,160
Because the cultural symbol of conscience

698
00:26:12,160 --> 00:26:13,920
naturally requires

699
00:26:14,039 --> 00:26:17,039
everyone who joins LXDAO to have a conscience.

700
00:26:17,359 --> 00:26:20,720
In other words, you must always act with a clear conscience.

701
00:26:21,119 --> 00:26:21,960
Yes, and this point

702
00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:23,359
is something I find particularly interesting.

703
00:26:23,359 --> 00:26:25,160
And we often ask each other

704
00:26:25,160 --> 00:26:26,359
if you have a conscience

705
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:27,559
and things like that.

706
00:26:27,559 --> 00:26:29,720
I think it's quite intriguing.

707
00:26:30,119 --> 00:26:33,839
Another interesting aspect is LXTalk.

708
00:26:34,599 --> 00:26:36,559
Hope everyone can come and listen

709
00:26:36,559 --> 00:26:39,000
and also hope everyone can

710
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:42,000
subscribe, like, share, comment. Thank you.

711
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:46,000
I think it's a group of very interesting people

712
00:26:46,119 --> 00:26:47,119
creating together,

713
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:48,400
and continuing to create,

714
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:51,000
conscientious public goods.

715
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:53,519
If I were to ask a soul-searching question,

716
00:26:53,559 --> 00:26:54,799
what is the meaning of life?

717
00:26:54,920 --> 00:26:57,359
Well, my answer is that life originally has no meaning,

718
00:26:57,519 --> 00:26:59,359
but there is a way to give it meaning,

719
00:26:59,359 --> 00:27:01,039
and that's through creation,

720
00:27:01,160 --> 00:27:02,960
finding a group of people to create with.

721
00:27:03,559 --> 00:27:05,559
It will make you feel more meaningful.

722
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:08,279
I prepared some

723
00:27:08,279 --> 00:27:08,960
salt

724
00:27:09,240 --> 00:27:11,359
hoping to freshen things up for everyone

725
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:13,160
and save my video a bit.

726
00:27:21,039 --> 00:27:25,400
If someone introduces you to DAO, what do you think?

727
00:27:26,440 --> 00:27:28,039
I hope LXDAO gets better and better.

728
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:32,160
I hope LXDAO makes a contribution to Web 3.

729
00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:34,359
Incubate more outstanding

730
00:27:34,359 --> 00:27:37,599
Web3 public goods projects that more people use.

731
00:27:37,599 --> 00:27:39,960
And I hope more ideas can

732
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:41,720
take root and grow here.

733
00:27:41,720 --> 00:27:43,000
I hope it can

734
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:44,519
go further and further.

735
00:27:44,519 --> 00:27:47,200
And in the Web3 ecosystem,

736
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:48,400
find its own position

737
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:49,640
and improve more and more.

738
00:27:50,519 --> 00:27:53,079
The name is a clear vision

739
00:27:53,359 --> 00:27:55,440
a moral motivation

740
00:27:56,319 --> 00:28:00,039
But LiangXin is also something rather different.

741
00:28:00,359 --> 00:28:03,559
I think we need to stick to our original intention

742
00:28:03,559 --> 00:28:05,240
which is conscience

743
00:28:05,240 --> 00:28:07,559
This is a bottom line that cannot be crossed

744
00:28:07,559 --> 00:28:10,759
We should cultivate more conscience genes

745
00:28:10,759 --> 00:28:13,160
That is, spread our cultural symbol of conscience

746
00:28:13,359 --> 00:28:14,359
To pass it on

747
00:28:14,359 --> 00:28:17,839
Whether it's in the Chinese-speaking world or in the whole world

748
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:22,319
Yes, conscience is actually a rare quality

749
00:28:22,799 --> 00:28:23,000
Right

750
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:26,799
I also hope that this precious conscience

751
00:28:27,920 --> 00:28:29,440
live long and prosper

752
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:33,400
There's a saying that goes very well

753
00:28:33,559 --> 00:28:35,039
The meaning of work

754
00:28:35,039 --> 00:28:37,759
is a group of people with feelings and righteousness doing

755
00:28:37,920 --> 00:28:39,400
meaningful things together

756
00:28:39,400 --> 00:28:41,160
Many companies may say this

757
00:28:41,160 --> 00:28:43,119
But I think LXDAO is doing it

758
00:28:43,359 --> 00:28:46,039
And I hope LXDAO's influence will grow

759
00:28:46,319 --> 00:28:46,960
And it can attract

760
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:49,039
More and more real builders.

761
00:28:49,119 --> 00:28:51,359
And together make this society better

762
00:28:51,599 --> 00:28:54,359
I feel very honored to be able to

763
00:28:54,759 --> 00:28:56,200
explore Web3 and future collaboration with everyone

764
00:28:56,200 --> 00:28:59,720
in this very early stage

765
00:28:59,720 --> 00:29:00,720
Because during this period

766
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:02,559
it's likely that it will be gone in a few years

767
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:06,720
And I also hope that some interested friends

768
00:29:06,799 --> 00:29:07,839
can join us

769
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:10,759
And we can explore together in this early stage

770
00:29:11,559 --> 00:29:13,759
Do some interesting things

771
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:17,160
And solve some meaningful problems

772
00:29:17,519 --> 00:29:19,920
Of course, I think in the next stage

773
00:29:19,920 --> 00:29:21,359
There might be a need

774
00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:24,039
To consider more business models

775
00:29:24,039 --> 00:29:27,440
To make us the strongest

776
00:29:27,920 --> 00:29:29,920
Developer community in the Chinese-speaking region

777
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,160
As a builder

778
00:29:32,160 --> 00:29:32,720
And at the same time

779
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:35,319
Also as a shareholder of our LXDAO

780
00:29:35,319 --> 00:29:36,319
I sincerely hope

781
00:29:36,319 --> 00:29:38,559
That LXDAO can eventually achieve success

782
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:40,640
To become the strongest DAO organization

783
00:29:41,319 --> 00:29:44,319
In our country

784
00:29:44,319 --> 00:29:45,119
And then

785
00:29:45,759 --> 00:29:47,519
Step out of Asia and go global

786
00:29:47,920 --> 00:29:49,519
Wishing everyone the best

787
00:29:49,519 --> 00:29:51,640
Together we rise higher

788
00:29:51,640 --> 00:29:54,039
Climate crisis

789
00:29:54,599 --> 00:30:01,440
What will crypto going to deal with Anthropocene

790
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:03,960
And also, besides that

791
00:30:04,559 --> 00:30:05,400
Let's gather more

792
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:06,799
Within the team

793
00:30:07,160 --> 00:30:10,400
All the members of LXDAO might consider organizing more events in the future

794
00:30:10,759 --> 00:30:12,119
To come together more

795
00:30:12,119 --> 00:30:12,920
Yes

796
00:30:13,319 --> 00:30:15,440
Although the story

797
00:30:15,839 --> 00:30:17,559
And then, I want to say to Web...

798
00:30:17,839 --> 00:30:18,359
Conscience

799
00:30:18,359 --> 00:30:19,960
I want to say to LXDAO

800
00:30:21,759 --> 00:30:22,559
What should I say

801
00:30:23,799 --> 00:30:26,000
What I want to say to LXDAO is...

802
00:30:27,640 --> 00:30:31,559
and it's you that write the story
